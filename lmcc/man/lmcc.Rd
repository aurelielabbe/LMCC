\title{lmcc: a Linear Model of Coregionalization with informative Covariates}
\description{
We propose a method to predict the missing methylation levels.
This method catches correlation structures among the methylation levels across genome sites and across samples.
The regression function linking the methylation level to the covariates
is modeled through a linear combination of the covariates together with latent factors.
We assume the covariates' and latent factors' effects to be Gaussian random processes (GP).
